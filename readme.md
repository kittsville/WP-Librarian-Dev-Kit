#WP-Librarian Development Kit

The WP-Librarian Dev Kit, not to be confused with the [WP-Librarian Dev, Kit](https://github.com/kittsville), is a WordPress plugin designed to make development of WP-Librarian easier by handling fixtures, asset minification and any other tasks that crop up which could be automated.

Currently this plugin is only capable of creating fixture items and members to test the functionality of WP-Librarian. In time loans and fines will be added then eventually asset minification, so [KitPipe](https://github.com/kittsville/KitPipe) can be put down.
