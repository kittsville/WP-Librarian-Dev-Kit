#WP-Librarian Development Kit

The WP-Librarian Dev Kit, not to be confused with the [WP-Librarian Dev, Kit](https://github.com/kittsville), is a WordPress plugin designed to make development of WP-Librarian easier by handling fixtures, asset minification and any other tasks that crop up which could be automated.

###Features

Currently this plugin can create fixture Items and Members as well as automatically minifying WP-Librarian's scripts/styles if they are modified. The generation of Loans and Fines will, in time, be added.
