# What?  
5000 entries of fixture data. Each entry can be used to make a WP-Librarian member

# How?  
These fixtures were generated from http://www.databasetestdata.com

# Why?  
It seemed the easiest way of dealing with fixtures for this kind of data. While my own code to create random names and emails/phone numbers would allow for a far greater number of fixtures to be generated it'd also take some time. Time which could be spent developing WP-Librarian!
