#WP Librarian Fixtures

This WordPress plugin is an addon for [WP-Librarian](/kittsville/WP-Librarian), providing the ability to create a selection of data to test the features and functionality of WP-Librarian. By using only hooks from the base plugin, WP-Lib-Fixtures is totally harmless on its own and can be installed on any WordPress site without moaning about lacking WP-Librarian. But, given its base plugin to work off of, WP-Lib-Fixtures can greatly ease development involving or of WP-Librarian by giving you a range of data to work with.

This is a while away from being ready.
