Generate fixture data to develop and test WP-Librarian

== Description ==
WP-Librarian is an inventory management system for WordPress. WP-Librarian-Dev-Kit is an addon for WP-Librarian that adds the ability to quickly generate Items, Members, Loans and Fines to work with. Test data is also tracked so that it can be deleted and easily as it was created, without having to reset your entire WordPress installation. The Dev Kit also automatically re-minifies any of WP-Librarian's script or style assets if they are changed.
