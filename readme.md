#WP-Librarian Development Kit

The WP-Librarian Dev Kit, not to be confused with the [WP-Librarian Dev, Kit](https://github.com/kittsville), is a WordPress plugin designed to make development of [WP-Librarian](https://github.com/kittsville/WP-Librarian) (a library management plugin) easier by handling fixtures, asset minification and any other tasks that crop up which could be automated.

Currently this plugin can generate item/member fixtures and minify assets. In future I'll be adding the ability to create fixture loans and fines.
